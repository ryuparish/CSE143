Bullshit to Come:
    - Correct types and/or return types
    - Java defined functions that do things you do not expect or do not know about
    - Prof. Schafer's nonsensical/obfuscative instructions and ambiguity.
    - Autocompletion in the trash Ed IDE that completes things in an unexpected way.
