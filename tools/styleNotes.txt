Ordering of code in classes
    1. Field Data
    2. Constructors
    3. Public Methods
    4. Private Methods

Commenting:
    BERP:
        Behavior : What does it do?
        Exceptions : Describe what would throw and exception
        Return : What is returned?
        Parameters : What is passed in?

Naming:
    Casing
        Fields, local variables, and methods should be camelCased, where every word after the first begins with capitalization.
        Class names and constructors should be UpperCamelCased. This is camel casing but the first word also begins with capitalization.
        Class constants should be SCREAMING_CASE, where words are all uppercase and separated by underscores.
